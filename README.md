### COVID19 Data Visualization
#### Take the cleaned datasets, us.csv and state.csv, that I scrapped and wrangled from the previous COVID19.DataMining project, I visualize the data updated up to August 17, 2020 to learn about:      
> #### **1. How many positive-confirmed, death, and recovered cases in the United Stated, and their proportions,**    
> #### **2. What the daily rates of change of those cases in the in the United Stated,**    
> #### **3. What the daily rates of change of positive-confirmed cases in 55 U.S. jurisdictions, including Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands,**   
> #### **4. What the 10 states in the U.S with the highest number and the 10 states/teritories with the lowest number of positive confirmed cases,**   
> #### **5. On what days the highest and the lowest number of positive-confirmed, death, and recovered cases in the U.S. to be found in a calendar heatmap for each of cases,**   
> #### **6. How the total of positive-confirmed case distributed among each of 50 states on a GIS map.**
